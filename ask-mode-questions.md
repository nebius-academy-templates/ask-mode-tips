# Fun Ask Mode Questions for Beginners ðŸš€

Hey students! Here are some fun questions you can ask about the `main.py` file to learn more about how it works. Just copy and paste these into your chat!

## 1. What Does This Code Actually Do? 
```
@main.py
"Explain what this main.py file does in simple terms. What happens when someone runs this program? Walk me through it like I'm 5 years old!"
```

## 2. Find the Cool Features! 
```
@main.py
"What are the coolest features in this main.py file? Show me the most interesting parts and explain why they're useful. What makes this program special?"
```

## 3. Break It Down Step by Step 
```
@main.py
"Can you trace through what happens when I run 'python main.py sample_sales_data.csv'? Take me through each step from start to finish!"
```

## 4. Error Detective Mode 
```
@main.py
"What could go wrong when using this program? Show me the error handling and explain what happens if someone gives it bad data or runs it incorrectly."
```

## 5. Make It Better Challenge 
```
@main.py
"If you were going to add one fun new feature to make this program more awesome, what would you add? Suggest something cool and show me where in the code it would go!"
```

**Pro Tip**: You can also tag other files like `@sales_report_generator.py` or `@data_processor.py` to ask questions about those too! 

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
